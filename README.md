#Chatbot for Disease prediction
## Project Overview

This project is a chatbot that helps users diagnose potential diseases based on their reported symptoms. It leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for natural language understanding and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating responses.

The chatbot is designed to assist users in identifying possible diseases based on their symptoms. It uses advanced machine learning models and a custom-built retrieval system to provide contextually accurate and useful information.
